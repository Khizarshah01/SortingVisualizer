## About

Sorting Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand how sorting algorithms work through visual representation. It provides a real-time view of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort as they process a randomized array.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Generate new arrays, adjust array size, and control sorting speed.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize different sorting techniques side-by-side.
- **Real-time Stats**: View the current sorting cycle count.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes.

## Algorithms

The current version supports the following algorithms:

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Bubble Sort** | O(n²) | O(1) | Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. |
| **Selection Sort** | O(n²) | O(1) | divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n²) | O(1) | Builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. |
